## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation is the process where a web app progressively gets reduced to its most baseline functionality at its lesser stages. Service workers add to this methodology by acting as a middle-man between the web app and the network, storing all the network requests regardless of connection. This allows for the user to continue to use the web app's baseline functionality and store its requests upon reconnecting. By leveraging service workers, developers can progressively enhance their applications, ensuring users receive an acceptable experience regardless of their browser capabilities.
